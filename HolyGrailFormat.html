        <header>The Header, which currently isn't using any kind of positioning type applied so defaults to static, 
            makes it so that the primary anchor is to the website itself. This allows it to be scrolled passed and 
            defaults it to the top of the screen without the need of any top, down, left, and right position inputs, 
            which would use the inital window resolution to determine where it would be.</header>
    
        <nav>The Nav bar, which currently is using the fixed position, makes it so that it will stay in that position on the 
            computer screen, so that you matter how you scroll, it will stay visible in that singular spot. it has also been
            displaced to from the top 170 pixels and the left 35 pixels which is why it is more centered on the screen
            instead of the top right

        <div>
    
            <div class="articles">
    
                <article>The Article is currently using the relative position, meaning that its 0,0 is based on the previous div class, 
                    that being the nav div class, and since it is 15 pixels from the top, it will start 15 pixels lower than
                the bottom of the nav bar</article>
    
                <article></article>
    
            </div>
    
        <aside>The aside is currently using the absolute position marker, meaning its position isn't based on any other
            div class object, and since it is 50% away from the left, 10% away from the right, and 235 pxs from the top of
            the screen, gives it the current position
